# MyPortfolio

This is an HTML file for a personal portfolio website. The website includes the following sections:

Header: Contains a navigation bar with links to different sections of the website.
Home: Introduces the website owner with their name, role, and a brief description. Also includes a download button for the resume and social media icons.
About Me: Provides more detailed information about the website owner, including their history, values, and key skills.
Skills: Displays the website owner's skills in various areas, such as frontend, backend, and full-stack development. Each skill is represented with a progress bar.
Projects: Lists the website owner's projects, including a brief description and technologies used.
Contact: Provides contact information, such as phone number and email address.

The website uses Bootstrap 5 for styling and responsiveness, and it includes custom CSS for additional styling. It also uses JavaScript for smooth scrolling when navigating between sections.

Additionally, the website integrates with Font Awesome and Ionicons for social media icons. The footer includes a copyright notice.

The HTML file includes several sections for each part of the website, with content placed inside appropriate tags such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. The file also includes several external links to libraries and frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

The website is designed to be a single-page application, with all content loaded initially and navigation handled through scrolling to different sections. This approach simplifies the website and improves performance, as there is no need to load new pages or content dynamically.
